Weather App -
Built a Weather App that displays current weather info based on a location entered by the user 🌍. It shows temperature, conditions, and other useful details ☀️🌧️❄️.

What I Learned:

• How to fetch and use data from a Weather API

• Handling user input and displaying dynamic data

• Improved my understanding of working with APIs.
